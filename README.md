## Custom Mod License Agreement
### Minecraft Fabric Mod Development Services — Tokimi

This License Agreement ("Agreement") governs all custom mod orders placed with Tokimi, operating under CozyStudios ("Tokimi" or "Developer"). By placing an order through Fiverr or any other agreed-upon platform, you ("Client" or "You") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms outlined in this Agreement.

---

## 1. Scope of Services

Tokimi provides custom Minecraft Fabric mod development services exclusively. Forge, NeoForge, Spigot, Paper, and other platforms are not supported under this Agreement.

The service is limited to programming and code development. Any textures, models, sounds, animations, or other assets required for the mod must be supplied by the Client unless otherwise agreed upon in writing prior to development or during development.

Tokimi may, at his sole discretion, provide supplementary assets (such as textures) at no additional cost. However, this is not guaranteed and should not be expected as part of the standard service.

## 2. Pricing and Custom Offers

All listed prices are starting points and are not final. Every mod is unique and pricing will vary based on scope, complexity, and estimated development time.

Clients must message Tokimi before ordering to discuss the project. A custom offer will be created based on the agreed-upon scope of work.

## 3. Intellectual Property and Ownership

**3.1 Code Ownership:** All source code, scripts, and programming work produced by Tokimi in the course of fulfilling an order remain the intellectual property of Tokimi. The Client receives a compiled mod file (e.g., .jar) for personal and private use, but does not receive ownership of the underlying source code unless explicitly agreed upon in a separate written agreement.

**3.2 Authorship and Credit:** Tokimi is the sole author and developer of all code produced under this Agreement. The Client may not claim authorship, co-authorship, or development credit for any mod created by Tokimi.

**3.3 Idea Rights:** Tokimi reserves the right to independently develop, expand upon, polish, and publicly release any mod concept or idea that originated from a Client order. This includes publishing to platforms such as Modrinth, CurseForge, or any other distribution channel, and generating revenue from such releases. The Client acknowledges and accepts this right upon placing an order.

## 4. Distribution Restrictions

The Client is strictly prohibited from distributing, uploading, sharing, or making the mod publicly available on any platform, including but not limited to Modrinth, CurseForge, Planet Minecraft, GitHub, or any other modding or file-sharing website.

If the Client wishes to publicly distribute the mod, they must purchase a separate Distribution License from Tokimi for a fee of **$250 USD**. This license must be agreed upon in writing before any distribution takes place.

Unauthorized distribution of the mod will be considered a breach of this Agreement and may result in legal action, a DMCA takedown request, or other remedies available under applicable law.

## 5. Content Creation and Personal Use

The Client is free to use the mod in any content creation activities, including but not limited to YouTube videos, Twitch streams, TikTok, social media posts, private servers, and personal gameplay. No permission or attribution is required for such use.

The Client may use the mod on private servers they own or operate, provided the mod is not made publicly downloadable.

## 6. Refund Policy

The Client has the right to request a refund if they believe the delivered mod does not match what was originally agreed upon in the custom offer.

All approved refunds are subject to a **35% processing and development fee**, which will be deducted from the total refund amount.

Tokimi reserves the right to dispute and deny a refund request if he believes the delivered work fulfills the agreed-upon scope of the order. In the event of a dispute, both parties agree to attempt resolution through Fiverr's resolution center or direct communication before pursuing any further action.

Refund requests must be submitted within **14 days** of delivery. Requests made after this period will not be honored.

## 7. Right to Refuse Service

Tokimi reserves the right to refuse, cancel, or terminate an order at any point during the development process, for any reason, at his sole discretion.

If an order is cancelled by Tokimi before completion, the Client will receive a full refund for any work not yet delivered. Partial refunds may be issued at Tokimi's discretion if partial work has been completed.

Reasons for refusal may include, but are not limited to: unreasonable scope changes, disrespectful communication, requests that fall outside Minecraft's ecosystem, or projects that conflict with Tokimi's values or schedule.

## 8. Modifications and Updates

Once the mod has been delivered and the order is marked as complete, any additional modifications, updates, bug fixes, or feature additions are considered new work and may be subject to additional charges.

Tokimi is not obligated to provide ongoing support, updates, or compatibility patches for delivered mods unless a separate maintenance agreement is established.

## 9. Warranty Disclaimer

The mod is provided "as is" upon delivery. Tokimi makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the mod's compatibility with future Minecraft updates, other mods, or third-party software.

Tokimi is not liable for any damages, data loss, server crashes, or other issues arising from the use or misuse of the delivered mod.

## 10. Confidentiality

Both parties agree to keep the details of the project and any shared materials confidential unless mutual written consent is provided.

Tokimi reserves the right to showcase the mod in a portfolio or promotional materials without disclosing the Client's identity, unless the Client requests otherwise in writing.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Tokimi be held liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to the mod or this Agreement.

Tokimi's total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the total amount paid by the Client for the specific order in question.

## 12. Governing Law and Disputes

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law.

Any disputes arising from this Agreement shall first be addressed through good-faith negotiation between the parties. If resolution cannot be reached, the dispute may be escalated through Fiverr's resolution process or other appropriate channels.

## 13. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties regarding the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements, or representations, whether written or oral.

Any amendments to this Agreement must be made in writing and agreed upon by both parties.

## Acknowledgment and Acceptance

By placing an order, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. This agreement is accepted automatically upon placing an order through Fiverr.
